# mXparserCalculator
This calculator uses mXparser so that strings entered via the on-screen buttons can be evaluated as mathematical expressions.  This allows the building of a true calculator instead of a simple app to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.  This can do that with any number of entered numbers, and can evaluate using parentheses and decimal points as well.  DecimalFormat is also used to shave off extra zeros or extra numbers.  Note that for mXparser, a .jar file (for JDK 1.8 in this case) had to be put into the "lib" folder, and a line was written to be implemented in the build.gradle (app) file.
